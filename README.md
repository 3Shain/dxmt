# DXMT

A Metal-based translation layer for Direct3D 11 which allows running 3D applications on macOS using Wine.

For the current status of the project, please refer to the [project wiki](https://github.com/3Shain/dxmt/wiki).

The most recent development builds can be found [here](https://github.com/3Shain/dxmt/actions).

## How to use

**DXMT is not ready for end-users**, albeit there is a [guide](https://github.com/3Shain/dxmt/wiki/DXMT-Installation-Guide-for-Geeks) for knowledged users.

### Logs
When used with Wine, DXMT will print log messages to `stderr`. Additionally, standalone log files can optionally be generated by setting the `DXMT_LOG_PATH` variable, where log files in the given directory will be called `app_d3d11.log`, `app_dxgi.log` etc., where `app` is the name of the game executable.

### Config file

- `DXMT_CONFIG_FILE=/xxx/dxmt.conf` Sets path to the configuration file. Check `dxmt.conf` in the project directory for reference.
- `DXMT_CONFIG="d3d11.preferredMaxFrameRate=30;"` Can be used to set config variables through the environment instead of a configuration file using the same syntax. `;` is used as a seperator.

### MetalFX Spatial Upscaling for Swapchain

Set environment variable `DXMT_METALFX_SPATIAL_SWAPCHAIN=1` to enable MetalFX spatial upscaler on output swapchain. By default it will double the output resolution. Set `d3d11.metalSpatialUpscaleFactor` to a value between 1.0 and 2.0 to change the scale factor.

### Metal Frame Pacing

`d3d11.preferredMaxFrameRate` can be set to enforce the application's frame pacing being controled by Metal. The value must be a factor of your display's refresh rate. (e.g. 15/30/40/60/120 is valid for a 120hz display).

### Debugging
The following environment variables can be used for **debugging** purposes.
- `MTL_SHADER_VALIDATION=1` Enable Metal shader validation layer
- `MTL_DEBUG_LAYER=1` Enable Metal API validation layer
- `MTL_CAPTURE_ENABLED=1` Enable Metal frame capture
- `DXMT_CAPTURE_EXECUTABLE="the executable name without extension"` Must be set to enable Metal frame capture. Press F10 to generate a capture. The captured result will be stored in the same directory as the executable.
- `DXMT_CAPTURE_FRAME=n` Automatically capture n-th frame. Useful for debugging a replay.
- `DXMT_LOG_LEVEL=none|error|warn|info|debug` Controls message logging.
- `DXMT_LOG_PATH=/some/directory` Changes path where log files are stored. Set to `none` to disable log file creation entirely, without disabling logging.

## Build

### Requirements:
- Meson 1.4+ (for project build system)
- CMake 3.27+ (for LLVM dependencies)
- Xcode 15+

### Instructions

After cloning this repository, inside the DXMT directory, run
```sh
./configure.sh
meson setup --cross-file build-win64.txt --native-file build-osx.txt -Dnative_llvm_path=toolchains/llvm-darwin build
```
`./configure.sh` will take some time (~1 hour) to configure the development environment, you only run it once.

Then run the follow command to actually compile DXMT
```sh
meson compile -C build
```
